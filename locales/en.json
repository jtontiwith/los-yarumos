You will experience a beautifully crafted space with fine finishing touches - this is not glamping or a cute-rustic cottage - it's instead as elegant as the natural beauty that surrounds it. Equipped with a bathtub, kitchen, 2 decks, queen bed, desk, fiber-optic internet, and the full experience of being up in the trees, it's the most unique lodging experience on the outskirts of Medellin.",
